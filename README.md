This program was made for the Department of Planning, Statistics and Programme Management, Government of West Bengal, India under Birla Institiute of Technology and Science, Pilani's Practice School 1 programme.

The script takes year-wise input in the form of .txt files for each crop for each district, and then outputs them into a set of .xlsx files grouped by year, one for each crop, sorted district wise.

The script uses [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/), and was converted to a .exe file using [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org) for in-office use and circulation.
